                <h2>All about BBQ</h2>
                    <p>Prior to the Civil War, southern barbecue centered primarily on pork. Pigs are easy to raise and grow more quickly than cattle, which made them a more viable source of meat for the region. Additionally,
                         when food supplies ran low, the pigs could be turned out into the forest to free-graze. Although this was convenient, it also made the pigs leaner at slaughter time, so slow-cooking the meat was also used as a way to tenderize it. In the years leading up to the Civil War,
                          southerners ate an average of five pounds of pork for every pound of beef; their reliance on the meat even became a source of pride and patriotism,
                         and it wasn’t uncommon for them to refuse to export the meat to the north.</p>
                    

                <h2>History of BBQ</h2>
                    <p>At its earliest origins, barbecue involved slow-cooking meat over sticks and saplings, a common activity among indigenous
                     Americans and Caribbeans. In the Caribbean, this style of cooking was known as “barbacoa” by the indigenous Taino people, which first appeared in the writings of Spanish explorers as early as the 16th century. The Taino were known to smoke and dry meat in the sun,
                     which could then be taken on long journeys or reconstituted with boiling water – the basis for modern-day jerky. </p>
